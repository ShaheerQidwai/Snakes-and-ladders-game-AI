Project Overview:
This project presents a modified version of the traditional Snakes & Ladders game, enhanced with strategic gameplay mechanics and an AI opponent. The key innovations include the addition of multiple paths (main, safe, and risky), trap and power-up tiles, and a heuristic-based AI that makes decisions on path selection, trap placement, and power-up usage. The project aims to create a more engaging game experience while showcasing decision-making AI.


Algorithm and Heuristic Design:

Path Choice Heuristic:
  AI prefers risky path when behind and safe path when ahead, also considering the traps placed on either paths as well.

Trap Placement Heuristic:
  AI places traps when the human is ahead and likely to land on the trap within 3â€“6 tiles. 
  The traps are efficiently used when the human is within reach and by placing a trap the AI can likely catch up or move ahead of the human.

Power-up Strategy: 
  AI chooses to disarm traps if any exist; otherwise, it selects an extra roll.
